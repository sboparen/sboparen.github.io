Fifteen custom puzzles I wrote for the game
[TIS-100](http://www.zachtronics.com/tis-100/)
as a participant in the
[puzzle design contest](https://www.reddit.com/r/tis100/comments/3a271m).

Each puzzle falls into one of three series:

**Quantum Entanglement Series:**
The left and right half of the segment have been disconnected,
and can only communicate through stack memory nodes.

**Computational Limits Series:**
These puzzles are meant to require complex solutions, which should
make cycle optimization quite labour intensive.

**Implementation Dependent Series:**
Puzzles which abuse behaviour specific to the game's implementation.
I believe that each of these puzzles has a valid implementation on
which it is unsolvable.

I have solutions for all of the puzzles,
although some may take issue with my definition of solution
in the case of EVERETT CALIBRATOR.

**UPDATE (April 2016):**
The intended solution to EVERETT CALIBRATOR stopped working when
testing behaviour was improved in the final version of TIS-100.
This is a good thing!  However, if you want to try the puzzle as
it was originally intended, the version here has been modified to
make all of the fixed test cases the same.

The modified timestamp metadata in the zip file has been rigged,
so the puzzles should show up in the correct order if you move the
extracted files into your custom puzzles directory.
Also, if you are currently away from your installation of TIS-100,
screenshots of the puzzles can be viewed below.
