There is an infamous qualifier problem used to evaluate the ability
of second-year students to create a complete program by themselves.
This problem is to read in a file consisting of a series of integers,
print out the integers (one per line), and then print them out again.

This is my tongue-in-cheek solution which shows that students using
C are not at a disadvantage, as they do not need a dynamically
resizing data structure to deal with the number of integers being
unknown until the end of the file is reached.
